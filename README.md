# Node.js Server Hanging Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js servers where improper error handling can lead to the server hanging after processing multiple requests. The example uses Express.js.

## Problem

The `server.js` file contains a simple Express.js server that sends a response after a 5-second delay.  Under heavy load or if an error occurs during request processing, this server may hang. The absence of error handling and resource management leads to this behavior. 

## Solution

The `server-solution.js` demonstrates improved error handling and resource management to prevent server hangs.  It handles potential errors and ensures resources are properly released.  A more robust implementation might employ a worker pool or a more sophisticated queue to manage concurrency effectively.
